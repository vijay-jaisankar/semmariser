# Semmariser

The app works by taking an mp3 file and transcribing it. It then uses rev-ai to transcribe and our model to summarize the content in a quick and efficient manner. This means that you can listen to a long podcast or audio file and get a summary of it in just a few minutes. The best part about Semmariser is that it is incredibly user-friendly and is accessible anywhere. All you have to do is upload your audio file, and the app takes care of the rest. In just a matter of minutes, you'll have a summary of the content that you can read on the go.
